This repository contains the tutorial for the metagenomics session at [NGSchool2025](https://ngschool.eu/ngschool2025/). This tutorial was orginally developed by Sarah Buddle for the Wellcome Connecting Science course in [Genomics for Clinical Virology](https://github.com/WCSCourses/GCV_2025). The second section of the tutorial is adapted from the publicly available training materials and documentation produced by CZID at https://czid.org/.
